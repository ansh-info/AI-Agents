All tests are now passing successfully. Let's analyze what's working:

1. Command Processing:

   - `help`: Correctly displays help message and sets `help_displayed` state
   - `search papers about LLMs`: Properly extracts query and sets `search_initiated` state
   - `search` (empty): Correctly prompts for query and sets `invalid_search` state
   - Invalid commands: Appropriately handles with `command_processed` state

2. State Management:

   - Status transitions are working
   - Step states are preserved
   - Messages are properly recorded
   - Search context is updated correctly

3. Ollama Integration:
   - Connection is stable
   - Response handling works
