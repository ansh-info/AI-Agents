1. Initialization works properly:

```
[DEBUG] Initializing EnhancedWorkflowManager
[DEBUG] Initializing clients...
[DEBUG] Initializing agents...
[DEBUG] Initializing ConversationAgent
[DEBUG] ConversationAgent initialized successfully
[DEBUG] Initializing SearchAgent
[DEBUG] SearchAgent initialized successfully
```

2. Conversation handling works:

```
[DEBUG] Processing command through new workflow: hi
[DEBUG] Parsing command: hi
[DEBUG] Detected conversation intent
[DEBUG] Handling conversation command: hi
[DEBUG] Detected greeting
```

3. Search functionality works:

```
[DEBUG] Processing command through new workflow: fetch papers on biology
[DEBUG] Parsing command: fetch papers on biology
[DEBUG] Cleaned query result: fetch biology
[DEBUG] Detected search intent
[DEBUG] SearchAgent: Starting search with query: fetch biology
```

4. Paper processing and state management works:

```
[DEBUG] Adding paper to SearchContext:
[DEBUG] Input paper data: {...}
[DEBUG] Created PaperContext with ID: ...
[DEBUG] Successfully added paper to results
```

5. Response generation works:

```
[DEBUG] Generating response
[DEBUG] Using system prompt: You are a helpful academic research assistant...
[DEBUG] Generated response length: 1228
```

The main improvements that are now working:

1. Proper intent detection between conversation and search
2. Correct handling of greetings vs search queries
3. Successful paper retrieval and processing
4. Proper state management and context tracking
5. Clean response formatting
