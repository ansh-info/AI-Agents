**Project Overview & Problem Statement:**

```
Building an Academic Research Assistant that helps users:
- Search academic papers efficiently
- Maintain contextual conversations about papers
- Ask questions about specific papers
- Compare and analyze multiple papers
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully

Technology Stack:
- LangGraph: State management & conversation flow
- Semantic Scholar: Academic paper search (with rate limiting)
- Ollama: LLM-based interactions
- Streamlit: User interface
```

**What We've Achieved:**

1. ✓ Core Components:

   - Base state management (agent_state.py)
   - API integration with rate limiting (semantic_scholar_client.py)
   - LLM integration (ollama_client.py)
   - Basic workflow (workflow_graph.py)
   - Enhanced workflow manager (enhanced_workflow.py)
   - UI implementation (dashboard.py)

2. ✓ Key Features:

   - Paper search functionality
   - Basic conversation handling
   - State management structure
   - Rate-limited API calls
   - Error handling
   - Debug panel
   - Formatted search results

3. ✓ Recent Improvements:
   - Added API rate limiting
   - Implemented retry logic
   - Better error handling
   - Improved result formatting

**Current Challenges & Next Steps:**

1. State Management:

   - Improve LangGraph state persistence
   - Better context maintenance
   - Enhanced memory management

2. User Experience:

   - Implement pagination
   - Add filtering options
   - Improve paper comparisons
   - Better conversation flow

3. Technical Improvements:
   - Add caching for repeated queries
   - Implement result filtering
   - Better error recovery
   - Enhanced paper context tracking

**Original Requirements Status:**
✓ Completed:

- Base state management
- API integration with rate limiting
- LLM integration
- Basic UI implementation
- Error handling
- Result formatting

⚠️ In Progress:

- LangGraph state optimization
- Conversation context maintenance
- Advanced paper interactions
- Memory persistence

❌ Not Started:

- Pagination
