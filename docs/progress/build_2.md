# Build 2

Here's a comprehensive summary of our work:

**Project Overview - Talk2Competitors: AI Agent Ecosystem**

- Purpose: Building an AI-powered research assistant for academic papers
- Current Phase: Phase 1 - Basic Setup and Search Implementation

**Architecture:**

```markdown
- Main Agent
  - Agent_S2 (Semantic Scholar Agent) [Current Focus]
    ✓ Basic State Management
    ✓ Command Processing
    ✓ LLM Integration (Ollama)
    - Paper Search [Next Step]
  - Agent_Zotero [Future]
  - Agent_PDF [Future]
  - Agent_Arxiv [Future]
```

**What We've Built:**

1. Working Components:

   - OllamaClient: Handles LLM interactions
   - EnhancedWorkflowManager: Manages command processing
   - State Management System
   - Command Processing Pipeline

2. Verified Functionality:
   - Command handling (help, search, invalid commands)
   - State transitions
   - LLM integration with Ollama
   - Test infrastructure

**Next Steps:**

1. Immediate:

   - Create Semantic Scholar API client
   - Integrate search functionality
   - Add paper metadata handling
   - Implement result pagination

2. Future Work:
   - Paper recommendation system
   - Cross-reference capabilities
   - Enhanced search features

**Key Files:**

```python
- ollama_client.py: LLM interaction
- agent_state.py: State management
- enhanced_workflow.py: Command processing
- test_ollama.py: Test infrastructure
```

**Configuration:**

- Using Ollama in Docker (model: llama3.2:1b)
- Local development setup
- Async command processing

**What We've Completed:**

1. Core State Management ✓

```python
# Basic agent structure established with:
- AgentState: Status tracking, memory, context
- SearchContext: Search parameters
- ConversationMemory: Message history
```

2. LangGraph State Management ✓

- Decided to simplify and remove LangGraph dependency for more direct control

3. Docker/Ollama Integration ✓

```bash
- Successfully integrated with Ollama running in Docker
- Model: llama3.2:1b
- Working API communication
```

4. Command Processing ✓

```python
Commands working:
✓ help
✓ search [query]
✓ Invalid command handling
```

**What's Left to Implement:**

1. Semantic Scholar Integration

```python
class Agent_S2:
    - Paper search functionality
    - Metadata handling
    - Results pagination
    - Paper recommendations
```

2. Future Phases:

```python
# Phase 2 Components:
- Agent_Zotero integration
- Bibliography management
- Citation tracking

# Phase 3 Components:
- Agent_PDF for document analysis
- Agent_Arxiv for paper retrieval
```

3. Additional Features:

```python
- Multi-paper analysis
- Cross-reference capabilities
- Advanced search features
- User interface
```

**From Initial Architecture:**

```markdown
Original Plan:

- Main Agent ✓
  - Agent_S2 (Semantic Scholar Agent)
    ✓ Search Papers [In Progress]
    - Single Paper Reco
    - Multi Paper Reco
  - Agent_Zotero [Pending]
  - Agent_PDF [Pending]
  - Agent_Arxiv [Pending]
```

**Next Immediate Task:**

- Implement Semantic Scholar API client
- Integrate with current workflow
- Add paper metadata handling
